# User Manager

This Vite-based project is a simple and intuitive User Manager App built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SASS. The app makes seamless use of the JSON Placeholder API to simulate real-world user data management in a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface.

## Features

- Create: Add new users by entering their name and email address.
- Read: View the existing list of users fetched from the API, with details including name and email.
- Update: Edit user details, allowing modifications to the name or email.
- Delete: Remove a user from the list entirely.

## User Interface

The app features a clean, responsive design aimed at providing an excellent UI/UX experience. It ensures ease of navigation with clear action buttons for creating, editing, and deleting users. The use of SASS provides a well-organized and scalable stylesheet structure, which helps in maintaining a neat and visually appealing layout.

- Form for Adding Users: A simple form interface allows you to create a new user, with input validation ensuring that both fields (name and email) are filled.
- User Listing: Existing users are displayed in a list, where you can view details at a glance.
- Action Buttons: Clear and user-friendly buttons for editing and deleting each user.
- Hover and Animation Effects: Smooth transitions and hover effects add to the interactivity of the app.

## Technologies Used

- Vite for fast and optimized development.
- Vanilla JavaScript for all dynamic interactions, API handling, and DOM manipulations.
- HTML to structure the content and elements of the page.
- SASS for structured and maintainable styles, making the project easily scalable.

This project aims to provide a user-friendly experience with a fast interface that allows the user to manage a list of users efficiently. It is a great example of how CRUD operations can be implemented with a simple and modern tech stack while leveraging an external API for data storage and management.
